# TwistedFizzBuzz

TwistedFizzBuzz is an enhanced implementation of the classic programming challenge FizzBuzz, built with .NET 7. It expands the simple number game into a versatile library capable of a wide range of number-based operations.

## Features
- **Range Input**: Handles sequences and non-sequential sets of numbers.
- **Custom Tokens**: Supports alternative tokens and divisors for customizable FizzBuzz experiences.
- **API Integration**: Retrieves and applies tokens from an external API.

## Projects
- **Library**: The core library offering FizzBuzz functionality.
- **StandardConsoleApp**: A console application implementing the standard FizzBuzz.
- **TwistedConsoleApp**: An application utilizing the library for a more complex set of rules.
- **Tests**: A suite of tests ensuring the robustness of the library.

## Installation
Ensure .NET 7 SDK is installed on your machine. Clone the repository and use `dotnet build` to compile the projects.

## Usage
Run `StandardConsoleApp` for the classic FizzBuzz. `TwistedConsoleApp` showcases the library's extended capabilities with its own set of rules.
